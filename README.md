# My linux dotfiles

These are the dotfiles that I use or that I've used in the past on my linux machine.

I mainly created this repo to keep track of my dotfiles and to make it easier to migrate them to any other linux machine. Nevertheles, if you're reading this, it probably means that you are interested in ricing your system, so I hope this can help in any way.
